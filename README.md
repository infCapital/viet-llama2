🌟 Viet-LLama2: Tailoring LLama2 for Vietnamese Language 🇻🇳

Welcome to the Viet-LLama2 project by InfCapital. We've taken LLama2, the remarkable language model developed by Facettook Meta, and made precise customizations to enhance its performance specifically for the Vietnamese language.

🚀 Project Focus:

📚 Fine-Tuned for Vietnamese: Viet-LLama2 is continued pretrain, instruction fine-tuning to understand and generate text in Vietnamese with a focus on accuracy and fluency.
💼 Specialized Adaptation: While we haven't reinvented the wheel, our efforts have been dedicated to fine-tuning LLama2 for more precise applications in areas like finance and beyond.
🌐 Continual Refinement: Our ongoing work involves pretraining, fine-tuning, and deployment to make Viet-LLama2 a reliable tool for various language-based tasks.
